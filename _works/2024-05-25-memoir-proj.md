In June 2023, [The Strategic Lab](https://linktr.ee/Thestrategiclab), an organization which specializing in the research and development of political and youth issues, partnered with the Regent of Batanghari to produce a biographical art book based on the manuscript written by a colleague and a good writer Melfin Zaenuri.

## Personal remarks and learning

I've worked on many books but rarely process on a work that has many assets. I used to be part of the student magazine design department, but apart from helping with the master layout and generalia, I only ever designed a few segments of showcases.

The situation presented to me is that at the early stage of design construction (general layout design and schematics derived from the brief) I was handed a rather long manuscript (about 21,000 words) and several dozen mixed photographs. I quickly pointed out to them that, according to the project definition, with such an amount of assets were not fit to build such an art book project, unless we fell to the textbook approach, which then soon we came to the concordance of them to provide more assets gradually.

Such a scenario requires me to strategize the general layout scheme to optimize the process. I was able to break down the project into a general scheme of modular configuration of layouts, which then serve as my master pages. The process of addition of assets is then just a matter of tallying the numbers and moving and swapping the page configurations. In addition, the client wanted the photo to be somewhat relevant to the topics, so I constructed the simple system to assign each asset with my own system of categorization (based on the reading the write-up), function similar to metadata. For photo management, I used the wonderful [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/), a photo management software, to take advantage of its powerful advanced tagging system.

Ultimately, this project, which is the first art book I've ever done, gave me insight into the importance of managing the project up front (and thankfully, my method works flawlessly to the end). Also, the importance of the initial discussion of the brief, which led to the construction of this project. The client was satisfied with the work and I appreciate the cooperation.
