In October 2022, [Antinomi Institute](https://antinomi.org), a non-profit organization consisting of scholarly writers, contacted me to handle the layout process of their translated works after a casual chat about LaTeX as a document processor. I, who had previously only dabbled with LaTeX as a helper for hobby projects, was genuinely delighted to take the reins of the entire process, which began with a complete handover of their code templates. I took the liberty of consulting and advising with the team for a code simplification and restructuring which was finally fully realized at the time of the work of their second project with me. So far, we've worked together on 3 projects, each with different schemata which is a real pleasure for me to work with.

I learned so much through the making of these projects, in which LaTeX introduced me to the world of manuscript optimization through scripting, the concept of markup language, and the world of text manipulations.
