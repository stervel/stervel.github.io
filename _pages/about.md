Writing (noun), for me, is a scourge. From bored scribbles to solid works, I'm all too familiar – that's not where my anxiety lies. Latent spaces dwell on the lonely writing. When something is thrown and written, the letters are separated from their creators. With what do the letters defend themselves at the front of the stern eyes of the readers?

This is the personal website, mainly functioning as a blog of me, Andre, to motivate myself to write, to encourage me to contain my random musings, and to overcome said anxiety. It's one of the good exercises of the mind, no? After all, it feels nice to carve out a little speck in the awesome internet, as I'm beginning to think that splurting your thoughts into cookie-cutter places (i.e. many social media) is never right and takes away the joy of expressing your mind. I'm not here to make a commodity for people to use after all, just to enjoy the luxury of what people in the past don't easily get: voicing your thoughts.

I rarely post, but trust me, my drafts are scattered; backlogs are neglected; many thoughts are constantly thrown into the bin. I'll get those published eventually. You can find the RSS URL you can use below, and I thank you for your interest on keeping up on this blog haha.

My comments, if any, are mere comments afterall and I am always open to ideas and feedback you might have. If you found the contents here interesting, feel free to hit me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@jirra) or mail me at duque(dot)volpeo(at)gmail(dot)com. I'd be glad.

I appreciate your visit! <3
