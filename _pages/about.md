Writing (noun), for me, is a scourge. From bored scribbles to solid works, I've done them all – that's not where my anxiety lies. Writing is a vehicle for spaces that are latent. When something is thrown and written, the children (letters) are separated from their mother. With what do the letters defend themselves at the front of the stern eyes of the readers?

This is the personal website, mainly functioning as a blog, of me, Andre, to motivate myself to write and overcome said anxiety. It's one of the good exercises of the mind, don't you think? After all, it feels nice to carve out a little speck in the awesome internet, as I'm beginning to think that splurting your thoughts into cookie-cutter places (e.g. many social media) is never right and takes away the joy of expressing your mind. I'm not here to make a commodity for people to use after all, just to enjoy the luxury of what people in the past don't easily get: voicing your thoughts.

I rarely post, but trust me, my drafts are scattered; backlogs are neglected; many thoughts are constantly thrown into the bin. I'll get those published eventually. You can find the RSS URL you can use below, and I thank you for your interest on keeping up on this blog haha.

My comments, if any, are mere comments afterall and I am always open to ideas and feedback you might have. If you found the contents here interesting, feel free to hit me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@jirra).

I appreciate your visit! <3
