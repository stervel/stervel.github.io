Writing (noun), for me, is a scourge. From bored scribbles to solid works, I've done them all, that's not where my anxiety lies. Writing is a vehicle for spaces that are latent. When something is thrown and written, the children are separated from their mother â€¦ except they can't defend themselves on their own, as letters do.

This is the personal website, mainly functioning as a blog, of me, Andre, to motivate myself to write. It's one of the good exercises of the mind, isn't it?

My comments about anything are mere comments afterall, and I am always open for any ideas and feedback. If you found the contents here interesting, feel free to hit me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@jirra).
